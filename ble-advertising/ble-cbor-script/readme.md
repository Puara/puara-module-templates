# BLE CBOR to OSC

This Python script works in conjunction with the BLE-advertising example to expose sensor values sent as CBOR by BLE advertisement packages as OSC messages.

## Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

`python ble-cbor-to-osc.py`

You can specify the osc output's address and port with `-a` and `-p`.
